# Analysis

## Layer 1, Head 4

This head seems to capture the relationship between the adverb (sadly / angrily / quickly) or a preposition if no adverb is present (through / across), a verb (passed away / spoke / ran / walked) it modifies, and the subject it belongs to (she / he).

Example Sentences:
- Sadly she passed away last [MASK].
- He spoke angrily about the [MASK].
- He ran quickly to catch the [MASK].
- He walked through a busy city street and explored a [MASK] neighborhood.

## Layer 4, Head 12

This seems to capture the object (street / neighborhood / her / a key) which receives the action of the verb (walked / explored / saw / found). 

Example Sentences:
- He walked through a busy city street and explored a [MASK] neighborhood.
- I saw her behind the [MASK] yesterday.
- She found a key in the [MASK].

## Layer 6, Head 2

This head seems to capture prepositional phrases relating to the MASK token (sailed across (mask) / danced around (mask) / down a narrow lane and through a small (mask)).

Example Sentences:
- They sailed across the [MASK].
- They danced around the [MASK].
- We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small [MASK].
